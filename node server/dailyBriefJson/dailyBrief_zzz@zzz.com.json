That’s why we have brought forward the publication of the Grid for the first time.\n\n'Financial services firms need to know what regulatory work is coming down the track, and this Grid will give them the opportunity and time to prepare. It also shows the need for further careful planning by the Forum members for the autumn.'\n\nDeputy Governor for Prudential Regulation, CEO of the Prudential Regulation Authority and Forum Co-Chair, Sam Woods, said:\n\n'A Grid pulling together the Forum members’ work programmes is a new resource for us and industry, and we would welcome feedback on this first version.\n\n'I hope the Grid will prove to be of real value in the immediate future as we navigate Covid-19, and as it evolves over time.'\n\nThe Grid will run as an initial 12-month pilot and will be published at least twice a year.\n\nNotes to Editors\n\n1. Link to information on the Regulatory Initiatives Grid.\n\n2.

The Court also found that Mr Skinner was aware that OPR was making false or misleading statements and dishonestly concealing material facts in its promotional material.\nMarketing agents Clive Mongelard (aka Clive Harris), Tyrone Miller and Venor Associates Ltd (“Venor”), who operated under the name “Gemini”, are jointly and severally liable to pay £1,207,050 in restitution for their roles in the unlawful promotion of OPR shares and for arranging for investors to acquire shares in OPR without authorisation. The Court also found that Venor advised investors on the merits of acquiring shares in OPR without authorisation and made false or misleading statements to consumers. Mr Mongelard was found to be involved in these breaches.\nThe FCA may not recover a total sum from all the Defendants greater than the total investor losses of £3,619,352.\n\nMark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:\n\n'Investors should stay clear of any unsolicited investment offers from unauthorised advisers or brokers. These businesses are breaking the law and will almost certainly lead to investment losses. \n\n'The FCA is able to take punitive and remedial action in some cases but the best protection is to avoid these types of offers completely.'\n\nOPR was a start-up company which promoted other companies’ products through its website for a commission. After initially failing to secure any investment from high net worth or sophisticated investors through an FCA authorised firm, OPR sought to raise funds from retail customers through two share offerings. OPR promoted them through unauthorised marketing agents who telephoned members of the public. The first share offering took place between October 2014 and March 2015 at 60p per share, and the second between March 2015 and November 2015 at £1 a share. A total of £3,619,352 was raised from 259 investors with individual investments ranging between £1,200 and £252,000.\n\nThe majority of the investors were introduced by Venor and Miller & Osbourne Associates Ltd (“M&O”). Mr Mongelard was the director of Venor and Mr Miller was the director of M&O, but they operated the businesses together under the name Gemini Asset Management.\n\nThe Court found that:\n\nMr Skinner misled an accountancy practice into producing letters purporting to approve OPR’s financial promotions, despite the fact that unauthorised accountancy practices cannot approve financial promotions.\nOPR’s marketing materials contained misleading or false statements. They did not disclose that marketing agents received circa 50% commission on the gross amount raised on any sale of shares by them and that a large part of the remaining funds invested by shareholders was funnelled to Mr Skinner via two shell companies. It also did not disclose accurately the status of trademark proceedings that had been brought against OPR.\nVenor included false and misleading statements in the scripts it used during sales calls, including that OPR was a very fast-growing company, that Mr Skinner was a personal friend of Richard Branson and that the band Madness had agreed to appear for free in an advert for OPR.\n\nM&O was dissolved on 6 August 2019.\n\nOPR entered administration on 25 April 2017, when responsibility for the remaining funds passed to the administrators: Harrisons Business Recovery and Insolvency Limited\n(link is external)\n.\n\nNext steps\n\nSubject to any appeals that may arise from today’s decision, the FCA will take steps to recover monies from the Defendants, so that it can return them to the investors.\n\nNotes to editors\nLink to information on how to report an unauthorised firm\nFind out more information about the FCA.","link":"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-secures-orders-victims-unauthorised-share-scheme"},{"source":"FCA","title":"Period to cover absent Senior Managers extended due to coronavirus (Covid-19)","date":"Wed May 06 2020","article":"The FCA has extended the maximum period firms can arrange cover for a Senior Manager without being approved, from 12 weeks to 36 weeks, in a consecutive 12-month period.\n\nThe modification by consent to rule SUP10.3.13R is available to all solo regulated firms.

At the FCA, we have been working with our partners here and abroad, to keep markets open and orderly, help firms continue to operate, protect consumers and small businesses, and to maintain high standards of conduct.\n\nAt the FCA, we have been working with our partners here and abroad, to keep markets open and orderly, help firms continue to operate, protect consumers and small businesses, and to maintain high standards of conduct - no-one will want to see a tail of misconduct post coronavirus.\n\nAnd at the same time, having left the EU in January this year, we all – the FCA and firms -  need to continue our preparations for the end of the transition period, set for 31 December this year.\n\nSo today, I will focus on:\n\nour national and international response to coronavirus, \nsome thoughts on future regulatory issues, \npreparing for the end of the transition period,\n\nand what this means for you.\n\nThe FCA's response to the coronavirus outbreak\n\nOver the course of the past weeks, we have been continuing to deliver in the public interest, for the benefit of consumers and markets.  As stated in our Business Plan which we published last month, this means focussing on:\n\nEnsuring fair treatment for consumers and small firms – making sure that firms give strong and clear support to customers, recognising challenges that everyone is facing;\nProtecting the most vulnerable – ensuring that they can get the financial services and the help they need;\nTackling scams – helping consumers avoid the scams that spring up as the pandemic develops;\nKeeping markets working well – ensuring that markets remain orderly;\nMitigating firm failures – mitigating the impact on consumers where firms fail in these challenging circumstances.\n\nFor consumers and small businesses, we have worked to build “financial bridges” to help them adjust to the impact of the pandemic, and until longer-term Government support is in place. For example:\n\nSupporting users of credit products, such as personal loans, credit cards, motor finance and overdrafts, who are in financial difficulty because of the outbreak;\nIssuing new guidance on the Government’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan and Bounce Back Loans Schemes; and\nWarning consumers of the increased risk of scammers trying to exploit the current uncertainty.\n\nFor firms and markets, our focus has been to keep markets open and orderly. This has meant easing operational pressures on firms where appropriate. For example:\n\nFor consumers and small businesses, we have worked to build “financial bridges” to help them to adjust to the impact of the pandemic, and until longer-term Government support is in place.\nWe provided flexibility over some regulatory requirements, gave some firms more time to publish their annual reports, and have provided forbearance on best execution reporting;\nWe modified our rules to facilitate some equity and debt capital raising, so firms can provide finance to businesses and aid the recovery; and\nWe delayed existing deadlines for Consultation Papers, such as our proposals to enhance climate-related disclosures.\n\nWe have stepped up market monitoring and firm and trade body outreach, which are essential to informing our response. This includes efforts to identify pressure points for firms and consumers. We also continue to engage with firms on their financial and operational resilience.\n\nWhilst we have provided this support to firms, firms need to continue to treat their customers fairly, and to operate with integrity. We have been encouraged by the positive steps firms have taken to help their customers.\n\nEqually, if we identify potential concerns with how firms might be acting, we will not hesitate to point this out and make clear our expectations, as we did in our Dear CEO letter last week, on ensuring fair treatment of corporate customers preparing to raise equity finance.\n\nWe are clear that the Senior Managers and Certification Regime obligations continue to apply, and that Senior Managers have a crucial role to play to ensure their firms continue to act appropriately and with integrity.\n\nNo-one will want to see a tail of misconduct appearing after this crisis abates. And if we suspect there may have been serious misconduct, we will investigate and where appropriate, take action.\n\nThe FCA's international work on coronavirus\n\nResponding to the outbreak is at the forefront of our priorities, and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. \n\nFirms need to continue to treat their customers fairly, and to operate with integrity. \n\nIn that, we are not alone: regulators and central banks around the world are doing the same. We have been working with them to provide clarity to firms where we can, share insights on market developments, and coordinate responses where necessary. This is crucial, as our markets are global, and interconnected. For example:\n\nWe have been engaging closely with many counterparts in the US to coordinate views on the relief measures both the US and the UK have taken, as well as to reach common agreement on the potential implications of coronavirus for LIBOR transition. On LIBOR, many of you will be aware that we published a statement alongside the Bank of England last week reiterating our central assumption that firms cannot rely on LIBOR being published after the end of 2021. There has been no change and that should remain the target date for all firms to meet.\nThe global standard-setting bodies - such as the Financial Stability Board and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), in which we are active participants - have had a key role to play as well. We worked with our fellow members of these bodies to publish coordinated statements in March and early April to call for markets to remain open and orderly, so that they can continue to perform their essential role in supporting businesses, governments, jobs and the broader economy. We have further worked within these global bodies to ensure global coordination and appropriate regulatory action.\nWe have also worked closely with our European partners and the European Supervisory Authorities in coordinating the response to coronavirus. Within the new parameters of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement, we have been invited to work together in close collaboration, to discuss issues we are seeing in our respective markets, and to pragmatically and openly address common challenges. For example, the approach both we and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have taken to regulatory reporting, corporate financial reporting, and accounting treatments of payment holidays are closely tied to EU law and had to be coordinated with relevant EU bodies.\n\nOverall, as here, the focus of the international response has involved offering supervisory flexibility where appropriate, delaying some scheduled rule changes which would have placed additional operational burden on firms at this extraordinary time, as well as re-prioritising non-essential supervisory work.\n\nEmerging trends in international financial regulation\n\nAlthough we are only a few months into this crisis, in our international work, we are beginning to look at its medium- to longer-term implications. This is likely to have implications for the markets we regulate in the UK, and our regulatory framework in the years to come. We are beginning to see the emergence of areas of future focus:\n\nResponding to the outbreak is at the forefront of our priorities, and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. In that, we are not alone: regulators and central banks around the world are doing the same. We have been working with them to provide clarity to firms where we can, share insights on market developments, and coordinate responses where necessary.\nFirst, while the financial system is more resilient and better placed to deal with the challenges we are seeing today than it was ten years ago, markets and their participants, from the largest globally-active firms through to locally-focused small businesses, will face growing funding and lending challenges as the economic impact of this health crisis is felt over time. We must remain vigilant to any problems in the financial markets and the effect on consumers and the real economy.\nSecond, firms’ operational resilience has come under a new focus. Given the UK’s large global markets and the outsourcing arrangements of many UK firms with significant operations in other countries, it is particularly important for the FCA and the UK in general to identify and address any increased vulnerability to disruption from unexpected events.\nThird, the interconnectedness of the global financial system highlights that the ability of financial intermediaries to manage their liquidity risks depends on continued credit flows, their ability to raise capital, and a willingness of lenders to keep lending during times of uncertainty. The UK’s position as a hub for financial services exposes the system to global risks, so it is a global ‘public good’ for the FCA, as well as the Bank of England and PRA, to stay ahead of evolving risks to ensure ongoing financial stability and market integrity. \n\nAcross these three areas, cooperation and close coordination with regulators, global standard-setting bodies and EU bodies will help us get to the right answers over time. As we move on from the initial crisis response, we will be looking more closely at these and other issues that have emerged in this crisis.\n\nIt will be important to get the post crisis recovery right, and to leverage off the experience of working through the pandemic.\n\nWe need to focus on areas that will not only help the global economy to recover, but also help to advance it further in the future.\n\nDuring this period, we have seen that we have had to work differently, moving to new way of working – whether through digital financial services platforms, or dispersed working - and it is important not to lose this energy when we come out of this crisis experience.\n\nWe need to focus on areas that will not only help the global economy to recover, but also help to advance it further in the future. In that context, we should expect continued regulatory focus on areas such as fintech, green finance and operational resilience.\n\nWe will continue to work with our regulatory partners, and indeed you, the industry, to develop this important regulatory framework for the future.\n\nOur work on Brexit\n\nAs you will know from recent press reports, the negotiations for a future EU-UK partnership are ongoing. The Government has been clear that the transition period is set to end on 31 December of this year. Here at the FCA, we continue to prepare for all scenarios.\n\nToday it is worth taking stock of where we are in those preparations, and what firms need to focus on in the coming period.\n\nWorking closely with the Treasury and the Bank of England, we have continued to do whatever we can within our remit to prepare for a range of scenarios, and ensure as smooth a transition as possible:\n\nThe Government has been clear that the transition period is set to end on 31 December of this year. Here at the FCA, we continue to prepare for all scenarios.\nWe have put in place transitional regimes, or ‘Temporary Permissions Regimes’, so that EEA firms and funds, which are currently doing business from the EU into the UK through passporting, can continue to have access to UK markets at the end of the Transition Period.\nWe have ensured that we have a functioning regulatory regime for when we leave the transition period by onshoring EU rules into our UK rules and legislation. To date, the Treasury has laid 62 Statutory Instruments, and we have published 1808 pages of rules. We continue with this process during this year, with new instruments such as EMIR 2.2 and amendments to EU prospectus, money laundering and low carbon benchmarks legislation being onshored in the coming months.\nTo help firms adapt to this new regime, we will make use of the power that the Treasury has given us to waive or modify new rules, the so-called 'Temporary Transitional Power (TTP)'.  This means that, up to 31 March 2022, firms will generally not need to prepare now to meet the changes to their UK regulatory obligations resulting from onshoring. We updated our website last week, explaining that we will use the flexibility it provides to apply it widely to a broad number of rules, although it is important firms realise that there are necessarily some exceptions. Our use of the TTP will minimise the risks of disruption due to firms’ adjustments to the new UK regime and ensure that consumers remain appropriately protected.\n\nThere are, however, some Brexit related risks which need multilateral or reciprocal action – they are not within our remit to address alone. Broadly, these fall into two categories:\n\nFirms should continue to consider what actions they need to take to be ready for the end of the transition period, and what this will mean for their customers.\nFirst, issues that could be resolved through reciprocal equivalence (such as the overlapping UK and EU share and derivatives trading obligations), and I will come back to equivalence in a moment.\nSecond, issues that cannot be resolved through equivalence, including broader contract continuity issues and the continued provision of retail financial services by UK firms to EU consumers. Whilst the FCA has put in place transitional regimes for EEA firms, the situation for UK firms in the EU is not the same. Their continued operations after the end of the transition period will depend on the regulatory regimes of individual EU member states. Whilst many of these member states had put in place temporary transitional regimes in the event of a ‘no-deal’ exit, the majority of these have now lapsed.\n\nSo firms should continue to consider what actions they need to take to be ready for the end of the transition period, and what this will mean for their customers.\n\nAs ever, we will continue to engage closely with firms, trade and consumer bodies on preparation for the end of the transition period over the course of this year.\n\nNow turning to our future relationship with Europe, and our future regulatory framework:\n\nThe Political Declaration last year, which sets out the ambition driving a future EU-UK relationship, commits both parties to assessing each other for equivalence by end-June 2020, across all relevant EU and onshored legislations. \n\nWe are continuing to work closely with the Treasury on this issue, and will continue to provide technical advice as requested. Our work on this remains on track.\n\nWe have publicly called for equivalence assessments to be done on an ‘outcomes basis’, in line with the EU’s stated approach\n(link is external)\n – in other words, that each country’s rules and supervision lead to equivalent outcomes, rather than needing to be identical.\n\nWe stand ready with the Bank of England, the Treasury, and with our international colleagues to tackle challenges over next period, pragmatically and at pace, whether relating to coronavirus, or for the end of the Brexit transition period. We will take whatever steps we can to keep markets open and orderly, protect consumers, and to smooth the transition. Firms must play their part and continue to treat their customers fairly, and to operate with integrity.\n\nOur work to onshore the EU rulebook also means that on ‘day one’, the UK will have the most equivalent framework to the EU of any country in the world. This provides a strong basis for the EU and UK to find each other equivalent across the full range of issues.\n\nWe also continue to advise the UK Government on EU-UK Free-Trade Agreement negotiations, on issues related to financial services, and regulatory and supervisory cooperation.\n\nWe continue to have strong relationships with our European counterparts, and will continue that going forward - as we have now, in tackling coronavirus.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, to conclude.\n\nWe stand ready with the Bank of England, the Treasury, and with our international colleagues to tackle challenges over next period, pragmatically and at pace, whether relating to coronavirus, or for the end of the Brexit transition period. We will take whatever steps we can to keep markets open and orderly, protect consumers, and to smooth the transition. Firms must play their part and continue to treat their customers fairly, and to operate with integrity.  \n\nAs well as tackling the immediate issues, we will play our part in shaping the national and international regulatory agenda for some time to come. With our international partners, we are considering the impact of the current crisis, what our forward focus should be, to economic recovery and beyond.\n\nFinally, Brexit reminds us that there is a set of issues beyond coronavirus. We all - the FCA and firms - need to continue to take steps to ensure a smooth exit out of the transition period.\n\nThank you.","link":"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/fca-national-international-response-coronavirus-brexit","keywordList":["digital"]},{"source":"FCA","title":"EU Traders Monitoring Team (clone of authorised firm)","date":"Wed May 06 2020","article":"Fraudsters are using the details of firms we authorise to try to convince people that they work for a genuine, authorised firm.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Securities Industry Council (SIC) and the Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) have today introduced temporary measures to allow with immediate effect until 30 September 2020, listed  issuers and parties involved in rights issues and take-over or merger transactions the option to electronically disseminate Offer Documents through publication on SGXNET and their corporate websites. There is thus no need to despatch hardcopy Offer Documents as required under the Securities and Futures Act, the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers, and the SGX Listing Rules. \n\n2.     The number of printers and mailing houses permitted to operate, and their manpower will continue to be restricted. The temporary measures to permit electronic dissemination will enable rights issues and take-over or merger transactions to take place while reducing the manpower needed to be physically present at workplaces to prepare, print and deliver a large number of Offer Documents.\n\n3.     Under the temporary measures, issuers and parties who opt to disseminate their Offer Documents electronically must send a hardcopy notification to shareholders with instructions on how they can access the electronic version of the Offer Documents. They must also send the hardcopy application or acceptance forms to shareholders. These requirements will ensure that shareholders continue to be informed of these significant corporate actions by mail during this time and facilitate their participation in the corporate actions. We also strongly encourage parties undertaking rights issues or take-over or merger transactions to allow shareholders to apply and pay for the subscription of rights issues, accept offers and inspect documents through the internet.\n\n4.     The temporary measures are effected through the introduction of the Securities and Futures (Offers of Investments) (Temporary Exemption from Sections 277(1)(c) and 305B(1)(b)) Regulations 2020 by MASfor rights issues and the adoption of alternative arrangements  by the SIC for takeover and merger transactions. SGX Listing Rules that require delivery of physical documentswill also not be applicable during this period.\n\n*****","link":"https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2020/electronic-dissemination-of-rights-issue-and-take-over-documents-allowed-until-30-september-2020"}]}

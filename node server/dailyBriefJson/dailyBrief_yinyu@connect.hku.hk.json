May 13 2020","article":"疫風肆虐全球，本港首季經濟收縮8.9%，為有史以來最大跌幅，企業迎來寒冬之際，初創企業生意也受到沉重打擊。科技園主席查毅超接受《香港01》專訪時坦言，目前環球及香港經濟都不樂觀，投資者態度較謹慎，對初創企業是「好大好大打擊」，但情況未至於令人過於憂慮，皆因投資者並非不再投資，只是延遲了洽談過程。他續稱，科技園除了提供租金寬免、財務支援及補助措施外，更會繼續為他們開拓市場及擴大投資渠道。初創企業遇冷，已有一段時間。查毅超表示，由去年社會運動開始，至到今年疫情，投資者及風險投資基金態度均轉為謹慎，令初創企業受較大衝擊。「我唔覺得投資者唔再投資，只係時間唔matching（匹配），咁樣對初創企業係好大好大打擊，因為佢哋係靠呢啲資金黎營運。」科技園自4月起向租戶及初創企業免租半年，在貸款方面，查毅超說提供資金貸款並非科技園的工作，初創企業可向銀行或者信保局申請。（資料圖片）有見及此，科技園在去年10月起，已向旗下所有商業租戶及初創公司提供50%的租金寬減，為期半年，今年4月再「加碼」，作出半年全額租金寛免。與此同時，又為旗下三個創業培育計劃，即Incu-App、Incu-Tech及Incu-Bio的成員，推出額外的資金補助，每間公司資助上限為7.5萬元，以助初創渡過這段低潮。投資者對人工智能等仍熱衷除了經濟前景暗淡，初創市場更是接連傳出壞消息，分別是軟銀決定取消收購WeWork，以及瑞幸咖啡財務造假事件，可說是「屋漏偏逢連夜雨」。不過，查毅超覺得這些只是個別例子，不會影響投資者的部署，投資者會因不同因素終止洽談交易，近期純粹是因為疫情而令洽談過程延遲，但未有因此不做交易，「我覺得疫情好返嘅時候，（投資）應該會返黎。」對於初創市場早前爆出的負面消息，查毅超認為投資者好聰明，不會受到一兩個個別例子影響。（資料圖片）被問及會否擔心出現初創企業倒閉潮，查毅超認為現時各行各業，包括創科，投資氣氛也是審慎，企業要保留自己財務上的實力，以便不時之需，但目前情況未至於十分負面，投資者仍對人工智能和機器人技術、健康相關行業較為熱衷。事實上，每逢經濟危機，總有一些創企憑着破壞性科技（Disruptive technology）成為逆市奇葩，例如Uber、Airbnb等在金融海嘯後發圍。他表示疫情改變了大眾的生活模式，催生「無接觸」經濟，例如外賣和網上購物等行業，不少人更願意使用新科技，這也是創科行業的營商機遇。現在大家只好使用Zoom作為網上教學和遙距開會工具，但將來一定可以有更好、更加適合此類用途的程式。「做初創嘅人諗下可以發掘咩商機，呢個係好大嘅空間，唔止香港會有人咁做，係全世界都發生緊嘅事。」查毅超認為這一疫改變大眾的生活模式，而經濟轉差，企業切勿過於樂觀，需要慬慎地作決定。（黃舒慧攝）何處創業 無特定方程式在開始創業時，創業地點和面向的市場都是重要因素，港府一直鼓勵青年人在粵港澳大灣區創業。可是，社會運動及疫情影響下，加深了中港兩地的矛盾，有部分年輕人更不願到內地發展。查毅超表示若果初創企業研發的科技產品針對本港市場需求，當然可以只在香港做生意，惟假若產品是應用於內地、一帶一路國家、以至亞洲市場，初創企業應好好思考應該如何投放資源和深耕該市場。「究竟要響香港、定係北上創業，係冇一個特定嘅formula（方程式），主要係睇公司個科技可以應用到邊度！」他續道，他自身接觸到做初創的年輕人，並沒有對進軍內地抱有抗拒的態度，希望年輕人在這方面的想法可以有所轉變。行業遇冷，可幸並未有發現有志投身創科行業的人大幅減少。他以科技園3月下旬舉辦的「香港科學園網上職業博覽2020」為例，活動提供1,000多個空缺職位，反應十分熱烈，首星期創下4萬名訪客及超過20萬瀏覽量，來自香港和海外的創科人才上載1.2萬多份履歷。同時，科技園亦有推出創意產業推廣項目「設計x 科技」（DXT）及iDM2硬件開發加速計劃，為初創企業完善產品設計，縮短產品開發週期，減少生產成本，園方會繼續為初創企業聯繫不同投資者和融資渠道、以及發掘更多與業界的合作機遇。","link":"https://www.hk01.com/專題人訪/471646/初創企業遇冷-科技園主席料投資者再回來-只是時間不匹配","keywordList":["technology"]},{"source":"HK01","title":"4月內地智能手機出貨量逾4000萬部　按年升超17%","date":"Tue

May 09 2020","article":"中國人民銀行（央行）日前宣布，將發行全球首款「中央銀行數位貨幣」（Central Bank Digital Currency, CBDC）——數位人民幣。目前，已經在部分地區，展開小規模封閉測試，究竟數位貨幣是什麼？▼▼▼點擊即睇六大常見疑問▼▼▼問題一：什麼是數位貨幣？「中央銀行數位貨幣」（Central Bank Digital Currency，CBDC），與一般紙鈔（法定幣貨）沒什麼不同，差別在於以數位虛擬的方式呈現，同樣必須遵守反洗錢、反恐融資等規範。去年六月， Facebook 提出虛擬密碼貨幣《Libra》白皮書後，引發各國監管機構關注，許多國家的央行，紛紛投入數位貨幣研究。北歐國家瑞典，是最早提出將法幣數位化的代表，該國本身無現金程度高， 目前僅有約19%的交易是以現金完成 。2017年開始，提出電子克朗（e-Krona）構想，將於近期展開封閉測試。北歐國家瑞典，是最早提出將法幣數位化的代表，該國本身無現金程度高， 目前僅有約19%的交易是以現金完成 。（Jonathan Brinkhorst/Unsplash）問題二：跟實體人民幣有何不同？要怎麼交易？數位人民幣就是人民幣紙鈔的虛擬版，兩者價值相同，若市面上流通的貨幣總量為人民幣100元，人行發行虛擬貨幣總量，就是人民幣100元，不會超額發行，一般民眾或法人機構都能直接從央行存取數位貨幣。數位人民幣背後有國家信用做背書，具有法定償還性質。民眾在手機上下載一款數位人民幣錢包後，不需連結銀行帳戶、綁定卡片，就能如同現金一樣消費交易。只要雙方手機都裝有數位貨幣錢包，拿起手機相互碰撞就能做到轉帳或支付。特別的是數位人民幣採用「雙離線技術」，就算沒網路也能使用，使用場景、體驗接近現鈔。只要雙方手機都裝有數位貨幣錢包，拿起手機相互碰撞就能做到轉帳或支付。（Arnel Hasanovic/Unsplash）問題三：跟密碼貨幣有何不同？會取代支付寶、微信嗎？跟密碼貨幣「去中心化」概念不同，數位人民幣由央行集中發行，以國家信用為擔保，發行量沒有上限，取決中國政經實力，特色是價格穩定，不會大幅波動，且數位人民幣就是法幣，不能拒收。密碼貨幣不同，以比特幣來說，設有發行上限（2100萬個），因為去中心化，沒有特定機構在背後做擔保，必須在收付款雙方都同意下才能完成交易。數位人民幣跟與支付寶、微信支付等行動支付，雖然都需要透過手機才能使用，背後仍有不少差異。數位人民幣跟與支付寶、微信支付等行動支付，雖然都需要透過手機才能使用，背後仍有不少差異。（Jonas Lee/Unsplash）例如，數位人民幣不需連接銀行帳戶或信用卡，還可以在不同支付工具間轉帳（支付寶與微信不能互轉）。至於數位人民幣普及後，是否有可能取代支付寶、微信？中國媒體認為，就目前情況看來，仍說不準。進一步分析，支付寶、微信之所以普及，是因為背後豐富的生態系，以及便利的服務， 若有一天中國當局強制用數位人民幣，取代第三方支付業者，在一家獨大情況下，不見得能維持服務水準，民眾未必買單。問題四：目前在中國發展進度如何？中國人民銀行（央行）在2014年，啟動數位貨幣研究計畫。目前，數位人民幣會在蘇州、雄安新區、成都、深圳等地，進行封閉測試。中國人民銀行強調，封測期間不會影響外部金融市場和經濟，短期內也不會考慮大規模推廣。目前，數位人民幣會在蘇州、雄安新區、成都、深圳等地，進行封閉測試。（Robert Bye/Unsplash）問題五：發行數位人民幣背後目的？目的一：打擊黑市交易和逃稅由官方發行的數位貨幣，能讓政府更有效率的，追蹤每一筆金錢流向、打擊黑市交易、金融貪腐，減少政府損失的稅收。目的二：加強管控數位貨幣由央行直接發行，民眾透過手機使用，政府可以跳過銀行，直接面對民眾。舉例來說，政府端出各種疫情紓困方案，若有數位貨幣，就能清楚追蹤紓困的資金，是否真的幫助到有困難的企業、個人；此外，像是口罩缺貨，政府也可以透過系統設定，限制每人錢包可以購買特定商品的數量。像是口罩缺貨，政府也可以透過系統設定，限制每人錢包可以購買特定商品的數量。（Mika Baumeister/Unsplash）問題六：背後風險有哪些？風險一：駭客攻擊風險因為貨幣數位化，增加系統不穩定、被駭客攻擊風險。例如，先前瑞典的支付系統「Swish」因為停電，造成大量遊客無法付款的窘境。風險二：恐對弱勢族群、遊客造成衝擊許多國家都有人口高齡化問題，以以無現金程度高的瑞典來說，該國三分之一的人口是55歲以上的高齡人口，如果太快棄現金而不用，將對老人、殘疾人士、移民、外國遊客造成衝擊。如果太快棄現金而不用，將對老人、殘疾人士、移民、外國遊客造成衝擊。（Chastagner Thierry/Unsplash）風險三：資料隱私問題無現金支付因為累積大量消費數據，無論是數據的使用、交換、保存，都是一般消費者難以控制及掌握的，這些金融數據幾乎等同於沒有畫面的監視器，四面八方地監控所有消費行為，這當中最大的受益者，恐怕就是數據持有者以及政府。風險四：商業銀行角色弱化數位貨幣發行後，無論是一般民眾或法人機構，都能直接從央行存取數位貨幣，不必透過商業銀行帳戶，且央行倒閉的風險，比一般商業銀行低，風險考量下，民眾不見得選擇一般銀行，如沒有提出更好的體驗或方案來吸引用戶，商業銀行角色將弱化。如沒有提出更好的體驗或方案來吸引用戶，商業銀行角色將弱化。（Macau Photo Agency/Unsplash）問題七：台灣目前進展如何？台灣央行總裁楊金龍，曾在去年的業務報告中表示，因為台灣具備以下三大優勢，所以沒有發行「中央銀行數位貨幣」的急迫性。1. 零售快捷支付系統發展早於其他先進國家2. 建置跨機構共用平台，優化電子支付基礎設施3. 推出金融區塊鏈函證業務台灣央行進一步指出，全球有約半數央行投入「中央銀行數位貨幣」研究，截至目前，僅有瑞典、中國進行小規模封測。主要是法規、技術仍不成熟，要發展成完全無現金的社會仍有難度。即便如此，楊金龍表示，台灣央行絕對會持續關注國際發展趨勢，適時研擬因應對策。延伸閱讀：行動支付盛行，為何中國政府還要推「數位人民幣」？7成人愛用感應支付！VISA讓「手機變身刷卡機」，能加速台灣無現金發展嗎？【本文獲「數位時代」授權轉載。】","link":"https://www.hk01.com/數碼生活/470573/電子人民幣推出怎樣運作-支付寶微信地位不再-即睇六大常見疑問","keywordList":["cbdc","digital"]},{"source":"HK01","title":"李澤楷：疫情衝擊未來數月仍浮現　寬頻流動通訊服務需求不減","date":"Fri

May 08 2020","article":"正當美國國內不斷傳出中國可能因新冠肺炎疫情（COVID-19）這種「不可抗力」而無法兌現第一階段貿易協議的採購承諾之際，白宮負責經貿事務、參加過中美貿易談判的貿易代表萊特希澤（Robert Lighthizer）和財長姆努欽（Steven Mnuchin）就站了出來，並接通了同中國副總理劉鶴的電話。中國強調「公共衛生」合作根據中方公布的消息，雙方提到要強化在「宏觀經濟」和「公共衛生」方面的合作，以便為第一階段貿易協議的落實創造條件。而美國貿易代表（USTR）辦公室方面公布的消息並沒有強調「公共衛生」這一點，只是提到雙方評估了新冠肺炎疫情最新一些情況對經濟的影響，以及彼此採取的相關應對舉措。也就是說，萊特希澤、姆努欽和劉鶴不光討論了第一階段貿易協議、兩國經貿議題，而且還就新冠肺炎疫情及其經濟影響進行了溝通。這在中方看來，就是要開展中美「公共衛生」領域的合作。這種合作恰好是美國高層近來很少提及的。美國總統特朗普（Donald Trump）、副總統彭斯（Mike Pence）及美國國務卿蓬佩奧（Mike Pompeo）雖然提到了可能的美中防疫合作，但他們大部分精力還是放在發佈「中國隱瞞疫情」和「武漢實驗室病毒」等不實指控方面，根本沒有直接同中國政府高層溝通過衛生領域合作的問題。這也是第一階段協議達成後萊特希澤同劉鶴的首次溝通。按照協議規定，萊特希澤和劉鶴等人應該是每半年溝通一次，討論協議的落實情況，此次通話明顯有些提前。其中原因和近來特朗普政府內部有關「威脅加徵新關税」以及「中國可能無法兌現協議中採購承諾」的聲音有關。舉例而言，自疫情全球蔓延後，針對中國如何在國內經濟受困、美國生產也受阻的情況下，在兩年內額外購買2,000億美元的美國商品，美國國內質疑聲很多。美國國會委任的美中經濟與安全審查委員會（USCC）4月就已經在一份報吿中指出，疫情導致貿易停滯、中國國內消費水平下滑，很有可能打亂中國對第一階段協議的落實情況，從而可能無法讓特朗普結束兩年多來的貿易戰。而且，根據最新經濟數據顯示，中國消費者支出在2020年前4個月按年下滑幅度超過20%，勞工短缺造成的產能下降問題也造成了2月份製造業萎縮力度達到2008年金融危機以來的最低水平。中國1月至2月工業增加值也按年下降了13.5%，屬於歷史上最大的一次經濟萎縮。以上這些數據加重了美國人關乎中國能否兌現協議承諾的擔憂。5月3日，特朗普在回答記者提問時也表示，中國必須兌現承諾，購買2,000多億美元價值的美國商品，否則自己將終止第一階段協議。而且，伴隨着對「武漢實驗室病毒」的指控，特朗普還威脅對中國加徵新的關税。可能正是特朗普方面的這種警吿，讓白宮經貿主談派站出來穩定局面。暫時放棄蓬佩奧后的一條外交主線在中國政府暫時「放棄」同蓬佩奧這條外交溝通線的背景下，這或許是除了「中美元首通話」以外能夠穩定當前動盪雙邊關係的唯一突破口。之前蓬佩奧因為頻繁發表對中國的不實指控，試圖將美國疫情失控嫁禍給中國，遭到中國政府的輿論反擊。中國官方欄目《新聞聯播》多次點名蓬佩奧的國務卿「資格」、甚至人格。中國國務委員楊潔篪2020年以來和蓬佩奧有過3次通話，其中2次是在疫情發生後進行，但都各自表述立場，無果而終。就在蓬佩奧帶頭指控之際，其背後的保守勢力也加大輿論攻勢，努力將中國置於國際社會的對立面、甚至呼籲將產業鏈遷離中國，包括重喊「脱鈎論」的口號。美國國務院和國防部還警惕盟邦在一帶一路和華為基建等中國項目方面的投資。而萊特希澤、姆努欽和劉鶴的這次通話，恰好平衡了美國國內的這種戾氣，再次強調了美中兩國的經貿聯繫，以此支撐當前因為疫情而愈發緊繃的雙邊關係。劉鶴和萊特希澤在此次通話中也同意繼續保持溝通協調。特朗普寄望經貿重啟當然，萊特希澤和劉鶴談及新冠肺炎疫情也是因為它是影響兩國經濟運行及第一階段貿易協議落實的最大變量。但在中美圍繞新冠肺炎疫情「起源」等熱點問題展開外交輿論戰之際，這種結合疫情和經濟的高層溝通，恰好凸顯了兩國真正的利益契合點所在。這個契合點也是謀求連任的特朗普不願放棄的，因為經貿復甦是特朗普連任競選的最大寄望。全球疫情導致交通運輸、旅遊、留學業務停滯，中小企業投資等業務陷入癱瘓，一些工廠也倒因此閉。中國產品供應規模的下滑尤其讓美國中小型企業深受其害，後者面臨資金短缺、供應面窄和庫存少等問題。疫情之下的大選年，特朗普要想連任，就是要在控制住疫情的同時穩住經濟，這種心理和政治需求從他近來急於重啟經濟就可以看出。雖然特朗普口頭上頻繁轉向批評中國，但萊特希澤和姆努欽等幕僚給他的建議依然是「美國經濟數月內回彈」。比如，姆努欽在5月3日接受美國有線電視新聞網（CNN）採訪時提到，隨着經濟重啟，預計經濟會在數月內反彈。特朗普近來的公開表態也都支持姆努欽的看法。所以說，姆努欽和萊特希澤等人雖然在疫情爆發之初做出過一些偏頗的論斷，導致他們被迫「低調」了一段時間，但就恢復經濟、施壓中國兌現協議承諾方面，他們在特朗普政府內部一直掌握話語權。而從他們和劉鶴的這次通話看，中國也在就落實第一階段協議展現誠意。中國推遲的「兩會」計劃5月末登場，預計會審議通過涉及中美第一階段協議的一些內容。值得注意的是，就在此次通話前，美國商務部調整了對華為的禁令，允許美國公司與華為合作參5G標準的制定，這反映出，相比所謂的國安利益，經濟利益永遠是第一位的。這對謀求個人政治利益的特朗普尤為如此。","link":"https://www.hk01.com/分析評論/470808/中美關係-蓬佩奧外交線中斷-白宮經貿團隊接通了劉鶴","keywordList":["5g"]},{"source":"HK01","title":"美或推5G新規　華為回應：不涉及產品買賣","date":"Thu

S$6 Million Grant Scheme to Support Singapore FinTech Firms","date":"Wed May 13 2020","article":"Singapore, 13 May 2020…The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore FinTech Association (SFA), AMTD Group and AMTD Foundation (collectively, AMTD) today announced the launch of a S$6 million MAS-SFA-AMTD FinTech Solidarity Grant (the Grant) to support Singapore-based FinTech firms amid the challenging business climate caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2   The Grant will help FinTech firms maintain their operations, and enable them to continue to innovate and grow. The Grant complements the S$125 million support package announced by MAS on 8 April 2020 to sustain and strengthen capabilities in the financial services and FinTech sectors.\n\n3   AMTD has provided an initial S$2 million to support the Singapore FinTech ecosystem. MAS will provide an additional S$4 million from the Financial Sector Development Fund, taking the total grant amount to S$6 million.  Applications for the Grant will open on 18 May 2020 and will be available until 31 December 2021.\n\n4   The Grant comprises two components:\n\nS$1.5 million Business Sustenance Grant (BSG). Eligible Singapore-based FinTech firms can receive a one-time grant for up to S$20,000 to cover day-to-day working capital expenditures, such as salaries and rental costs.  The short-term assistance will help FinTech firms sustain their operations and retain their employees. The BSG is fully funded by AMTD’s contribution.\nS$4.5 million Business Growth Grant (BGG). Eligible Singapore-based FinTech firms can receive up to S$40,000 for their first Proof of Concept (POC) with financial institutions on the API Exchange (APIX)platform, and S$10,000 for each subsequent POC, subject to a total cap of $80,000 per firm for the entire duration of the grant. The BGG enables these companies to continue to innovate in partnership with financial institutions and create opportunities for growth. The BGG is jointly supported by AMTD and MAS.\n\nIn addition, the BGG will provide funding for the salaries of undergraduate interns, capped at S$1,000/month per intern. This grant will support around 120 interns in the FinTech sector, assuming an average internship duration of 3 to 5 months.  We hope to encourage FinTech firms to continue to offer internships and develop the local FinTech talent pipeline.\n\n5   FinTech firms can apply for both BSG and BGG if they fulfil the eligibility criteria for both grants. SFA will administer and review the grant applications.\n\n6.   Mr Chia Hock Lai, President, SFA said, “FinTech firms are in a great position to seize opportunities presented by the accelerated trend towards digital financing induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Business Sustenance Grant helps FinTech firms to plug their short term financing gaps while Business Growth Grant enables them to grow and sell through the APIX platform. These will help save jobs while making our FinTech firms competitive for the post COVID-19 economic recovery world.”\n\n7.   Mr Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer of MAS, said, “There is a surge in demand in the financial services industry around the region for solutions to address the need for remote digital services amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. FinTech firms have a great opportunity to step up actively during this period to provide these solutions. The Business Growth Grant will help FinTech firms offset their costs. By conducting their POCs on APIX, financial institutions and FinTech firms will not need to set up test infrastructure for integration.  This will help accelerate project development while still working remotely.”\n\n8   Mr Calvin Choi, Chairman and CEO of AMTD Group, and Founder and Chairman of AMTD Foundation, said, “As an active financial institution focusing in the Asian region, we see the immediate need for the private sector to foster closer partnership with FinTech firms to formulate tailor made solutions to cater for the increasing demand for digital services and greater opportunities to scale up. This is an important moment in time to overcome challenges while identifying every opportunity and client servicing angle through proactive collaboration with the APIX platform to achieve FinTech success and FI transformation. The Business Sustenance Grant and the Business Growth Grant provide a holistic solution to ensure sustainability and growth opportunities for FinTech firms during the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\n9   For more information about the grant, please visit SFA website at www.singaporefintech.org  on the application process and criteria.\n\nAbout Singapore FinTech Association (SFA)\nThe SFA is a cross-industry and non-profit organisation.

The sector is sufficiently diversified with more than 130 significant global, regional and local companies that trade energy products. Singapore is also an important regional storage, blending and distribution hub for refined oil products. While Hin Leong is related to UT Singapore Services Private Limited which owns Universal Terminals by common shareholdings, Universal Terminals is operated independently of Hin Leong. Besides Universal Terminals, there are other independent oil terminal operators in Singapore including Vopak, Oiltanking and Tankstore.\n\n3.     MPA has assessed that there will be no serious impact on Singapore’s bunkering industry. There may be some short-term minor disruptions due to the lapse of contractual obligations by Ocean Bunkering Services and Hin Leong Marine International. The Singapore bunkering sector is well diversified with 43 other licensed bunker suppliers, including Minerva Bunker and TFG Marine which recently received their licences.\n\n4.     ESG and MPA will continue to work with stakeholders to ensure that Singapore’s supply chain for oil products and bunkering operations continue to function well without disruption.\n\n5.     MAS is in close contact with the banks on developments related to Hin Leong.  MAS agrees with the assessment by ESG and MPA and has reminded the banks not to de-risk indiscriminately from the bunkering and oil trading sectors.  Banks should, however, continue to apply judicious credit assessment on individual borrowers to manage their risks.\n\n6.     The banks are well capitalised and diversified in their exposures to these sectors. MAS is also closely monitoring liquidity and credit conditions in the market which, on the whole, continue to be supportive of households and businesses.\n\n*****\n\nAbout Enterprise Singapore (ESG)\n\nEnterprise Singapore is the government agency championing enterprise development.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has launched the MAS SGD Facility for ESG Loans (the Facility) in partnership with Enterprise Singapore (ESG), to lend Singapore Dollars (SGD) at an interest rate of 0.1% per annum to eligible financial institutions, to support their lending to SMEs under the ESG Loan Schemes. The ESG Loan Schemes comprise the Enhanced Enterprise Financing Scheme - SME Working Capital Loan (EFS-WCL) and the Temporary Bridging Loan Programme (TBLP).\n \n2   The Facility will help financial institutions to make loans to SME borrowers more affordable.  In pricing SME loans, financial institutions typically take into account their cost of funds, their cost of underwriting, and a credit spread to reflect the risk profile of the borrower. By providing financial institutions funding at the low interest rate of 0.1% per annum, for a two-year tenor, the Facility reduces the financial institutions’ cost of funds for loans made under the ESG Loan Schemes.  This will help SMEs manage their cash flow better amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n3   The Facility complements the enhancements to the ESG Loan Schemes announced on 6 April 2020 as part of the Solidarity Budget, where the Government increased its risk-share of loans to 90%.  The TBLP is intended to help local enterprises manage their immediate cash flow needs. SMEs that require additional working capital beyond the TBLP can tap on the EFS-WCL.\n\n4   The Facility also reinforces MAS efforts to ensure ample SGD funding to banks in Singapore, by maintaining a high level of SGD liquidity in the banking system, so that they can continue to play their role in providing credit to individuals and businesses in Singapore.\n\n5   Mr Ravi Menon, Managing Director, MAS, said, “The MAS Facility works in tandem with the ESG Loan Schemes to help lower borrowing costs for SMEs.  With the Government sharing 90% of the risk on such loans and MAS providing funding at almost zero cost under the Facility, banks and finance companies will be able to make more loans to SMEs and at lower cost - in fact, we expect them to do so.  Together with the various relief measures that banks and finance companies are providing SMEs as part of the package announced by MAS on 31 March 2020, this latest initiative will help provide strong support to our SMEs, which are a vital part of our economy.”\n\n6   Mr Png Cheong Boon, Chief Executive Officer of Enterprise Singapore, said, “We are happy to partner MAS to provide lower cost of funding to the financial institutions. Together with higher risk sharing by the Government, we hope that financial institutions would be able to extend loans under the TBLP and EFS-WCL at lower interest rates to more SMEs, thereby helping them to ease their cash flows, sustain their operations and retain their workers during this difficult period.” \n\n***\n\nAbout the Monetary Authority of Singapore\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is Singapore’s central bank and integrated financial regulator.

At the FCA, we have been working with our partners here and abroad, to keep markets open and orderly, help firms continue to operate, protect consumers and small businesses, and to maintain high standards of conduct.\n\nAt the FCA, we have been working with our partners here and abroad, to keep markets open and orderly, help firms continue to operate, protect consumers and small businesses, and to maintain high standards of conduct - no-one will want to see a tail of misconduct post coronavirus.\n\nAnd at the same time, having left the EU in January this year, we all – the FCA and firms -  need to continue our preparations for the end of the transition period, set for 31 December this year.\n\nSo today, I will focus on:\n\nour national and international response to coronavirus, \nsome thoughts on future regulatory issues, \npreparing for the end of the transition period,\n\nand what this means for you.\n\nThe FCA's response to the coronavirus outbreak\n\nOver the course of the past weeks, we have been continuing to deliver in the public interest, for the benefit of consumers and markets.  As stated in our Business Plan which we published last month, this means focussing on:\n\nEnsuring fair treatment for consumers and small firms – making sure that firms give strong and clear support to customers, recognising challenges that everyone is facing;\nProtecting the most vulnerable – ensuring that they can get the financial services and the help they need;\nTackling scams – helping consumers avoid the scams that spring up as the pandemic develops;\nKeeping markets working well – ensuring that markets remain orderly;\nMitigating firm failures – mitigating the impact on consumers where firms fail in these challenging circumstances.\n\nFor consumers and small businesses, we have worked to build “financial bridges” to help them adjust to the impact of the pandemic, and until longer-term Government support is in place. For example:\n\nSupporting users of credit products, such as personal loans, credit cards, motor finance and overdrafts, who are in financial difficulty because of the outbreak;\nIssuing new guidance on the Government’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan and Bounce Back Loans Schemes; and\nWarning consumers of the increased risk of scammers trying to exploit the current uncertainty.\n\nFor firms and markets, our focus has been to keep markets open and orderly. This has meant easing operational pressures on firms where appropriate. For example:\n\nFor consumers and small businesses, we have worked to build “financial bridges” to help them to adjust to the impact of the pandemic, and until longer-term Government support is in place.\nWe provided flexibility over some regulatory requirements, gave some firms more time to publish their annual reports, and have provided forbearance on best execution reporting;\nWe modified our rules to facilitate some equity and debt capital raising, so firms can provide finance to businesses and aid the recovery; and\nWe delayed existing deadlines for Consultation Papers, such as our proposals to enhance climate-related disclosures.\n\nWe have stepped up market monitoring and firm and trade body outreach, which are essential to informing our response. This includes efforts to identify pressure points for firms and consumers. We also continue to engage with firms on their financial and operational resilience.\n\nWhilst we have provided this support to firms, firms need to continue to treat their customers fairly, and to operate with integrity. We have been encouraged by the positive steps firms have taken to help their customers.\n\nEqually, if we identify potential concerns with how firms might be acting, we will not hesitate to point this out and make clear our expectations, as we did in our Dear CEO letter last week, on ensuring fair treatment of corporate customers preparing to raise equity finance.\n\nWe are clear that the Senior Managers and Certification Regime obligations continue to apply, and that Senior Managers have a crucial role to play to ensure their firms continue to act appropriately and with integrity.\n\nNo-one will want to see a tail of misconduct appearing after this crisis abates. And if we suspect there may have been serious misconduct, we will investigate and where appropriate, take action.\n\nThe FCA's international work on coronavirus\n\nResponding to the outbreak is at the forefront of our priorities, and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. \n\nFirms need to continue to treat their customers fairly, and to operate with integrity. \n\nIn that, we are not alone: regulators and central banks around the world are doing the same. We have been working with them to provide clarity to firms where we can, share insights on market developments, and coordinate responses where necessary. This is crucial, as our markets are global, and interconnected. For example:\n\nWe have been engaging closely with many counterparts in the US to coordinate views on the relief measures both the US and the UK have taken, as well as to reach common agreement on the potential implications of coronavirus for LIBOR transition. On LIBOR, many of you will be aware that we published a statement alongside the Bank of England last week reiterating our central assumption that firms cannot rely on LIBOR being published after the end of 2021. There has been no change and that should remain the target date for all firms to meet.\nThe global standard-setting bodies - such as the Financial Stability Board and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), in which we are active participants - have had a key role to play as well. We worked with our fellow members of these bodies to publish coordinated statements in March and early April to call for markets to remain open and orderly, so that they can continue to perform their essential role in supporting businesses, governments, jobs and the broader economy. We have further worked within these global bodies to ensure global coordination and appropriate regulatory action.\nWe have also worked closely with our European partners and the European Supervisory Authorities in coordinating the response to coronavirus. Within the new parameters of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement, we have been invited to work together in close collaboration, to discuss issues we are seeing in our respective markets, and to pragmatically and openly address common challenges. For example, the approach both we and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have taken to regulatory reporting, corporate financial reporting, and accounting treatments of payment holidays are closely tied to EU law and had to be coordinated with relevant EU bodies.\n\nOverall, as here, the focus of the international response has involved offering supervisory flexibility where appropriate, delaying some scheduled rule changes which would have placed additional operational burden on firms at this extraordinary time, as well as re-prioritising non-essential supervisory work.\n\nEmerging trends in international financial regulation\n\nAlthough we are only a few months into this crisis, in our international work, we are beginning to look at its medium- to longer-term implications. This is likely to have implications for the markets we regulate in the UK, and our regulatory framework in the years to come. We are beginning to see the emergence of areas of future focus:\n\nResponding to the outbreak is at the forefront of our priorities, and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. In that, we are not alone: regulators and central banks around the world are doing the same. We have been working with them to provide clarity to firms where we can, share insights on market developments, and coordinate responses where necessary.\nFirst, while the financial system is more resilient and better placed to deal with the challenges we are seeing today than it was ten years ago, markets and their participants, from the largest globally-active firms through to locally-focused small businesses, will face growing funding and lending challenges as the economic impact of this health crisis is felt over time. We must remain vigilant to any problems in the financial markets and the effect on consumers and the real economy.\nSecond, firms’ operational resilience has come under a new focus. Given the UK’s large global markets and the outsourcing arrangements of many UK firms with significant operations in other countries, it is particularly important for the FCA and the UK in general to identify and address any increased vulnerability to disruption from unexpected events.\nThird, the interconnectedness of the global financial system highlights that the ability of financial intermediaries to manage their liquidity risks depends on continued credit flows, their ability to raise capital, and a willingness of lenders to keep lending during times of uncertainty. The UK’s position as a hub for financial services exposes the system to global risks, so it is a global ‘public good’ for the FCA, as well as the Bank of England and PRA, to stay ahead of evolving risks to ensure ongoing financial stability and market integrity. \n\nAcross these three areas, cooperation and close coordination with regulators, global standard-setting bodies and EU bodies will help us get to the right answers over time. As we move on from the initial crisis response, we will be looking more closely at these and other issues that have emerged in this crisis.\n\nIt will be important to get the post crisis recovery right, and to leverage off the experience of working through the pandemic.\n\nWe need to focus on areas that will not only help the global economy to recover, but also help to advance it further in the future.\n\nDuring this period, we have seen that we have had to work differently, moving to new way of working – whether through digital financial services platforms, or dispersed working - and it is important not to lose this energy when we come out of this crisis experience.\n\nWe need to focus on areas that will not only help the global economy to recover, but also help to advance it further in the future. In that context, we should expect continued regulatory focus on areas such as fintech, green finance and operational resilience.\n\nWe will continue to work with our regulatory partners, and indeed you, the industry, to develop this important regulatory framework for the future.\n\nOur work on Brexit\n\nAs you will know from recent press reports, the negotiations for a future EU-UK partnership are ongoing. The Government has been clear that the transition period is set to end on 31 December of this year. Here at the FCA, we continue to prepare for all scenarios.\n\nToday it is worth taking stock of where we are in those preparations, and what firms need to focus on in the coming period.\n\nWorking closely with the Treasury and the Bank of England, we have continued to do whatever we can within our remit to prepare for a range of scenarios, and ensure as smooth a transition as possible:\n\nThe Government has been clear that the transition period is set to end on 31 December of this year. Here at the FCA, we continue to prepare for all scenarios.\nWe have put in place transitional regimes, or ‘Temporary Permissions Regimes’, so that EEA firms and funds, which are currently doing business from the EU into the UK through passporting, can continue to have access to UK markets at the end of the Transition Period.\nWe have ensured that we have a functioning regulatory regime for when we leave the transition period by onshoring EU rules into our UK rules and legislation. To date, the Treasury has laid 62 Statutory Instruments, and we have published 1808 pages of rules. We continue with this process during this year, with new instruments such as EMIR 2.2 and amendments to EU prospectus, money laundering and low carbon benchmarks legislation being onshored in the coming months.\nTo help firms adapt to this new regime, we will make use of the power that the Treasury has given us to waive or modify new rules, the so-called 'Temporary Transitional Power (TTP)'.  This means that, up to 31 March 2022, firms will generally not need to prepare now to meet the changes to their UK regulatory obligations resulting from onshoring. We updated our website last week, explaining that we will use the flexibility it provides to apply it widely to a broad number of rules, although it is important firms realise that there are necessarily some exceptions. Our use of the TTP will minimise the risks of disruption due to firms’ adjustments to the new UK regime and ensure that consumers remain appropriately protected.\n\nThere are, however, some Brexit related risks which need multilateral or reciprocal action – they are not within our remit to address alone. Broadly, these fall into two categories:\n\nFirms should continue to consider what actions they need to take to be ready for the end of the transition period, and what this will mean for their customers.\nFirst, issues that could be resolved through reciprocal equivalence (such as the overlapping UK and EU share and derivatives trading obligations), and I will come back to equivalence in a moment.\nSecond, issues that cannot be resolved through equivalence, including broader contract continuity issues and the continued provision of retail financial services by UK firms to EU consumers. Whilst the FCA has put in place transitional regimes for EEA firms, the situation for UK firms in the EU is not the same. Their continued operations after the end of the transition period will depend on the regulatory regimes of individual EU member states. Whilst many of these member states had put in place temporary transitional regimes in the event of a ‘no-deal’ exit, the majority of these have now lapsed.\n\nSo firms should continue to consider what actions they need to take to be ready for the end of the transition period, and what this will mean for their customers.\n\nAs ever, we will continue to engage closely with firms, trade and consumer bodies on preparation for the end of the transition period over the course of this year.\n\nNow turning to our future relationship with Europe, and our future regulatory framework:\n\nThe Political Declaration last year, which sets out the ambition driving a future EU-UK relationship, commits both parties to assessing each other for equivalence by end-June 2020, across all relevant EU and onshored legislations. \n\nWe are continuing to work closely with the Treasury on this issue, and will continue to provide technical advice as requested. Our work on this remains on track.\n\nWe have publicly called for equivalence assessments to be done on an ‘outcomes basis’, in line with the EU’s stated approach\n(link is external)\n – in other words, that each country’s rules and supervision lead to equivalent outcomes, rather than needing to be identical.\n\nWe stand ready with the Bank of England, the Treasury, and with our international colleagues to tackle challenges over next period, pragmatically and at pace, whether relating to coronavirus, or for the end of the Brexit transition period. We will take whatever steps we can to keep markets open and orderly, protect consumers, and to smooth the transition. Firms must play their part and continue to treat their customers fairly, and to operate with integrity.\n\nOur work to onshore the EU rulebook also means that on ‘day one’, the UK will have the most equivalent framework to the EU of any country in the world. This provides a strong basis for the EU and UK to find each other equivalent across the full range of issues.\n\nWe also continue to advise the UK Government on EU-UK Free-Trade Agreement negotiations, on issues related to financial services, and regulatory and supervisory cooperation.\n\nWe continue to have strong relationships with our European counterparts, and will continue that going forward - as we have now, in tackling coronavirus.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, to conclude.\n\nWe stand ready with the Bank of England, the Treasury, and with our international colleagues to tackle challenges over next period, pragmatically and at pace, whether relating to coronavirus, or for the end of the Brexit transition period. We will take whatever steps we can to keep markets open and orderly, protect consumers, and to smooth the transition. Firms must play their part and continue to treat their customers fairly, and to operate with integrity.  \n\nAs well as tackling the immediate issues, we will play our part in shaping the national and international regulatory agenda for some time to come. With our international partners, we are considering the impact of the current crisis, what our forward focus should be, to economic recovery and beyond.\n\nFinally, Brexit reminds us that there is a set of issues beyond coronavirus. We all - the FCA and firms - need to continue to take steps to ensure a smooth exit out of the transition period.\n\nThank you.","link":"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/speeches/fca-national-international-response-coronavirus-brexit","keywordList":["digital"]}],"BIS":[{"source":"BIS","title":"Saudi G20 Presidency and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub invite global innovators to find solutions to the most pressing financial regulatory & supervisory challenges","date":"Wed Apr 29 2020","article":"TechSprint competition to highlight potential of new technology to tackle regulatory and supervisory challenges.\nSaudi G20 Presidency to fund cash prizes for most promising solutions to the operational problems announced today.\nTechSprint is supporting the regulatory and supervisory responses against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Saudi G20 Presidency and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub today launched the G20 TechSprint Initiative to highlight the potential for new technologies to resolve regulatory compliance (RegTech) and supervision (SupTech) challenges. \n\nThe BIS Innovation Hub, through its Singapore Centre, and the Saudi G20 Presidency have published high-priority RegTech/SupTech operational problems and invite private firms to develop innovative technological solutions.

Under the overarching theme, the presidency firstly aims for empowering people by creating conditions in which all people, especially women and youth, can live, work, and thrive. Secondly, it aims for safeguarding the planet by fostering collective efforts to protect our common heritage. Thirdly, it aims for shaping new frontiers by adopting long-term and bold strategies to utilize and share the benefits of innovation. \n\nThe Saudi G20 Presidency has made \"Framing Supervisory and Regulatory Issues for the Digital Era\" a priority under its Financial Sector Issues agenda. Under this overarching priority, the Presidency is working to \"Facilitate Innovation in Technology-Enabled Regulatory and Supervisory Solutions (RegTech and SupTech)\". Indeed, the increase of technology adoption in the financial market is transforming the financial landscape, creating both opportunities and challenges for regulators and regulated entities alike. \n\nAbout the BIS Innovation Hub \n\nThe BIS Innovation Hub was established in 2019 to identify and develop in-depth insights into critical trends in financial technology of relevance to central banks, to explore the development of public goods to enhance the functioning of the global financial system, and to serve as a focal point for a network of central bank experts on innovation. At present, there are Hubs in Switzerland, Singapore and Hong Kong, with more planned. \n\nAbout the MAS \n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is Singapore's central bank and integrated financial regulator. As central bank, MAS promotes sustained, non-inflationary economic growth through the conduct of monetary policy and close macroeconomic surveillance and analysis. It manages Singapore's exchange rate, official foreign reserves, and liquidity in the banking sector. As an integrated financial supervisor, MAS fosters a sound financial services sector through its prudential oversight of all financial institutions in Singapore - banks, insurers, capital market intermediaries, financial advisors, and stock exchanges. It is also responsible for well-functioning financial markets, sound conduct, and investor education. MAS also works with the financial industry to promote Singapore as a dynamic international financial centre. It facilitates the development of infrastructure, adoption of technology, and upgrading of skills in the financial industry. \n\nAbout the FSB \n\nThe Financial Stability Board coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. \n\nAbout APIX \n\nAPIX is the world's first cross-border, open-architecture API platform, where financial institutions and FinTechs can integrate and text solutions via a cloud-based architecture. Through APIX, financial institutions and FinTech firms can discover one another on a curated global marketplace, design experiments collaboratively in the sandbox and deploy innovative solutions rapidly at a lower cost. APIX is a flagship product of the ASEAN Financial Innovation Network (AFIN), a non-profit entity formed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, and the ASEAN Bankers Association, with the objectives of supporting financial innovation and inclusion around the world. \n\nAbout R2A \n\nThe RegTech for Regulators Accelerator (R2A) partners with leading financial sector authorities to pioneer SupTech applications for financial sector regulation, supervision, and policy analysis. With support from R2A, financial authorities access new datasets and enhance their intelligence to establish a body of knowledge and evidence that drives financial inclusion and ensure financial stability, integrity, and consumer protection. Through R2A, partner financial authorities re-imagine how they collect and manage data, and harness technology to improve the speed, quality, and comprehensiveness of information in support of targeted, risk-based decision-making. \n\nR2A also engages closely with technology innovators to create structured opportunities for them to propose solutions and collaborate with financial authorities in the design and testing of promising ideas. Launched in October 2016, the R2A team has already partnered with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the Mexican Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV) and the Central Bank of Nigeria to develop and test next-generation SupTech solutions.

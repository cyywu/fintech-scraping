Where this is the case, we expect firms to notify us as soon as possible at firm.queries@fca.org.uk.\n\nFirms should try to ensure that all customers are not disadvantaged because of delays and make particular efforts to contact customers who do not use online services. While we understand that obligations for paper documents may be difficult to meet on usual timescales and will show flexibility in how we approach such issues, we expect firms to send communications in a timely manner. In particular, we are concerned that vulnerable customers, who are often more likely not to use online services, are still protected.\n\nFirms should demonstrate to us any steps they have taken to mitigate the impact of non-compliance with postal and paper processes and then return to full compliance as soon as practical. Firms could, for example, collect post and process paper-based work as frequently as they can, if this is not possible daily; and ensure they return client funds promptly, where they are unable to proceed with a transaction due to a delay and/or change in situation.\n\nWe expect firms to provide general updates on how it will treat incoming and outgoing post, and cheques, through its website and other public channels (such as social media). These communications should update customers on market conditions, explain how customers can check their financial statements (which may arrive late) and invite customers to contact the firm if they wish.\n\nFor suitability assessments, we recognise that face-to-face meetings are not possible. In such circumstances, we expect firms to use other methods to conduct a suitability assessment, such as phone calls and relevant due diligence checks online. We would then expect a firm to send out the assessment without delay, whether online (for those customers that use online or email services) or by post.\n\nFirms should ask those who have sent instructions or cheques which have not been processed to contact the firm urgently by telephone or electronic means. Where a customer has made a payment by cheque which has not been processed, we expect firms to consider the potential harm caused by not being able to cash the cheque on a case-by-case basis and ensure, where possible, they receive the services/cover they require (for example, retrospective cover). Where the uncashed cheque represents client money under the Client Assets Sourcebook (CASS) regime and the firm provides the service/cover without cashing the cheque, firms must consider whether proceeding in this way might breach CASS and expose other clients to the risk of a client money shortfall. See https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/client-assets-coronavirus for more details. \n\nFor specific information for authorised fund managers on paper-based and manual processes, see our dedicated web page. Information for fund managers on extensions to the deadlines for publishing certain fund reports and accounts can be found on this web page.\n\nFor specific information on how we expect firms to handle complaints, see our dedicated web page.\n\nThe arrangements above will be reviewed as the coronavirus pandemic develops. But firms should revert to complying with the requirements as soon as reasonably practicable, and not wait on a further statement from us. \n\nThis statement does not affect any legal rights that customers may have.","link":"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/how-firms-should-handle-post-and-paper-documents"},{"source":"FCA","title":"Investorable","date":"Wed May 13 2020","article":"We believe this firm has been providing financial services or products in the UK without our authorisation.

The Grant complements the S$125 million support package announced by MAS on 8 April 2020 to sustain and strengthen capabilities in the financial services and FinTech sectors.\n\n3   AMTD has provided an initial S$2 million to support the Singapore FinTech ecosystem. MAS will provide an additional S$4 million from the Financial Sector Development Fund, taking the total grant amount to S$6 million.  Applications for the Grant will open on 18 May 2020 and will be available until 31 December 2021.\n\n4   The Grant comprises two components:\n\nS$1.5 million Business Sustenance Grant (BSG). Eligible Singapore-based FinTech firms can receive a one-time grant for up to S$20,000 to cover day-to-day working capital expenditures, such as salaries and rental costs.  The short-term assistance will help FinTech firms sustain their operations and retain their employees. The BSG is fully funded by AMTD’s contribution.\nS$4.5 million Business Growth Grant (BGG). Eligible Singapore-based FinTech firms can receive up to S$40,000 for their first Proof of Concept (POC) with financial institutions on the API Exchange (APIX)platform, and S$10,000 for each subsequent POC, subject to a total cap of $80,000 per firm for the entire duration of the grant. The BGG enables these companies to continue to innovate in partnership with financial institutions and create opportunities for growth. The BGG is jointly supported by AMTD and MAS.\n\nIn addition, the BGG will provide funding for the salaries of undergraduate interns, capped at S$1,000/month per intern. This grant will support around 120 interns in the FinTech sector, assuming an average internship duration of 3 to 5 months.  We hope to encourage FinTech firms to continue to offer internships and develop the local FinTech talent pipeline.\n\n5   FinTech firms can apply for both BSG and BGG if they fulfil the eligibility criteria for both grants. SFA will administer and review the grant applications.\n\n6.   Mr Chia Hock Lai, President, SFA said, “FinTech firms are in a great position to seize opportunities presented by the accelerated trend towards digital financing induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Business Sustenance Grant helps FinTech firms to plug their short term financing gaps while Business Growth Grant enables them to grow and sell through the APIX platform. These will help save jobs while making our FinTech firms competitive for the post COVID-19 economic recovery world.”\n\n7.   Mr Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer of MAS, said, “There is a surge in demand in the financial services industry around the region for solutions to address the need for remote digital services amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. FinTech firms have a great opportunity to step up actively during this period to provide these solutions. The Business Growth Grant will help FinTech firms offset their costs. By conducting their POCs on APIX, financial institutions and FinTech firms will not need to set up test infrastructure for integration.  This will help accelerate project development while still working remotely.”\n\n8   Mr Calvin Choi, Chairman and CEO of AMTD Group, and Founder and Chairman of AMTD Foundation, said, “As an active financial institution focusing in the Asian region, we see the immediate need for the private sector to foster closer partnership with FinTech firms to formulate tailor made solutions to cater for the increasing demand for digital services and greater opportunities to scale up. This is an important moment in time to overcome challenges while identifying every opportunity and client servicing angle through proactive collaboration with the APIX platform to achieve FinTech success and FI transformation. The Business Sustenance Grant and the Business Growth Grant provide a holistic solution to ensure sustainability and growth opportunities for FinTech firms during the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\n9   For more information about the grant, please visit SFA website at www.singaporefintech.org  on the application process and criteria.\n\nAbout Singapore FinTech Association (SFA)\nThe SFA is a cross-industry and non-profit organisation.
